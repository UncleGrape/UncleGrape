## Project Assumptions
* User is in China behind the GFW and not using a VPN
* Discovery of GFW advoidance results in loss of Users' life
* User is not able to read/write code
* User will incorrectly follow setup instructions
* Web Host running UncleGrape is secure and trusted
* Web Host running UncleGrape is in a 5/9/14 eyes country (engress/ingress traffic is being watched)
* Deep Package Inspection is occuring between user and proxy
* AI based behavior monitoring policies are deployed against User or Web Host traffic
